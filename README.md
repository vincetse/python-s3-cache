# S3 Cache for Python

[Niall McCarroll](http://www.mccarroll.net/) wrote a neat little [AWS S3 cache](http://www.mccarroll.net/snippets/s3boto/index.html) on his blog that I found really useful, but could not find on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), so here it is in a refactored form as a public service.
